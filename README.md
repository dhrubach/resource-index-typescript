# Resource Index - TypeScript

A curated list of typescript resources which I have found useful to learn the language

## Preface

When starting a new language / framework / platform, I look for a comprehensive list of resources on the topic. To that extent, I use [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists. It is truly an **_awesome_** effort by the community to maintain such an exhaustive list. 

At the same time, I often feel intimidated to look at such a long list, a sinking feeling of where to start and how much to cover. More so, over a period of time as I deep dive into a topic, I loose track of the videos I have watched, books I have read and articles I have referred. While I have tools like feedly, pocket and evernote in my arsenal, I always wanted a single list of resources which _I_ have covered. Hence this list.
